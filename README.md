## Exercise: Filtering and Transforming Data

### Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to practice using Java's Predicate and Function interfaces to filter and transform data efficiently. You will work with a list of items and apply predicates to filter items meeting specific criteria. Additionally, you will use functions to transform items and generate a new list of results.

### Instructions:
You are provided with a list of Product objects, each representing a product with attributes like name, price, and category. Your task is to complete the following objectives using Predicate and Function interfaces:

### Filter Products
-	Create a filterProducts method that takes a list of products and a Predicate<Product> as parameters.
-	Use the provided Predicate to filter products based on the given criteria.
-	Return a new list containing the filtered products.

### Transform Product Names
-	Create a transformProductNames method that takes a list of products and a Function<Product, String> as parameters.
-	Use the provided Function to transform the product names into uppercase.
-	Return a new list with the transformed product names.
